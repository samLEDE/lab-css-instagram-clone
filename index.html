//what I should have done different

- make a box for the Instagram logo and the log-in buttong since they are right next to one another. 
- look at the webspage to devide vertical instead of horizontal 

managed to create a frame work for how to do it better when I came early for class.article
Decided that since I am not great at design (dont see the logic yet)
 that it would be better to organise a pre made framwork that I can make use of. 

Re-make this weekend.

        <p>Oh yeah, did we mention it's free?</p>
